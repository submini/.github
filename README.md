# Subminimal GitHub Team (SUBMINI) 🍞🚇

Welcome to the **Subminimal GitHub Team** — known as **SUBMINI**, a papaya-themed, subway-vibed team of passionate devs creating funky, chaotic, and surprisingly polished projects (mostly games... for now 👀).

We’re the upper-tier branch of a two-tier dev network — rising from our roots in the “Red Team” (FULLTIMATEteam) to form the **Papaya-tier**: a creative, slightly unhinged, and tightly collaborative space for ambitious ideas.
