# Subminimal GitHub Team (SUBMINI) üçûüöá

Welcome to the **Subminimal GitHub Team** ‚Äî known as **SUBMINI**, a papaya-themed, subway-vibed team of passionate devs creating funky, chaotic, and surprisingly polished projects (mostly games... for now üëÄ).

We‚Äôre the upper-tier branch of a two-tier dev network ‚Äî rising from our roots in the ‚ÄúRed Team‚Äù (FCN) to form the **Papaya-tier**: a creative, slightly unhinged, and tightly collaborative space for ambitious ideas.
